# CS50-AI-Neural-Networks-ps5
This repository contains the Traffic project from the neural networks week of the CS50 AI course. The project involves using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of traffic signs accurately. Developed as part of the course to demonstrate the application of deep learning in computer vision tasks.
